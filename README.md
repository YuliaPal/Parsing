# Python_projects
Parsing job offers with a keyword 'python' from stackoverflow.com and data import to csv.
Run main.py to start this project.
In so.py I extracted the last page number on the website and got title, company name, location and link for each job offer.
In save_csv.py I wrote all the job information to csv file.
